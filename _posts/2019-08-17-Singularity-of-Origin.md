title: " Singularity of Origin: A DNS Rebinding Attack Framework"
---

In 2019, GÃ©rald Doussot and I published the most comprehensive DNS rebinding attack framework [Singularity of Origin](https://github.com/nccgroup/singularity).
Singularity contains everything required to perform DNS rebinding attacks.
The framework provides reliable default settings that work out of the box, performs DNS rebind-ing in up to 3 seconds, has built-in payloads for vulnerable applications, and allows to completely automate the scanning and exploitation of vulnerable services on a network.

We presented the results of the speed improvements, DNS protection bypasses, and many more features at DEF CON 27 & BSidesLV in 2019 in Las Vegas.
